<h3>
"service" package : 
</h3>
<p>
This package contain the class "GetFromAPIws". The main r√¥le of this class is to do API request to a file  : "test_API.php".</br>
 And test_API.php do request to "https://api.insee.fr/entreprises/sirene/V3/siret/" . Why should we use this test_API.php file ????
We use it to avoid HTTPS SSL error in JAVA SPRING
